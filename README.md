# Welcome to the project

Welcome! This my submission for Nexthink's Front End Development interview.

The goal of this submission was to develop a Vue.js site that relies on a WordPress REST API that uses custom content types.

This website is a fun quiz to help you pick your style of vampire for this year's Halloween.

See the README files in the client and server directories for more information.
